# Dotfiles 2.0

Making it myself instead of forking an existing repo.

Inspirations/conversations:
- Ian Landsman
- Andrew Morgan
- Jose Soto

# TODO
- Add hammerspoon the app, and also figure out how to symlink some elements from ~/.hammerspoon directory in if possible (remember, the lua watcher doesn't catch changes to symlinked files)
- Add karabiner elements
- Add Goku and start Goku config, and symlink Goku config
